If Doris then sends Erin another payment on that channel that would result in Doris not having enough liquidity to honor the cached secrets, Erin is incentivized to refuse that payment (and possibly request that Doris close out the channel and open a new channel with more liquidity). Until that point, Erin can cache the secrets as much as she wants. This is good if the number of individual payments is very high.</p><h3 name=\"4a1a\" id=\"4a1a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Closing the proportional hashlock</h3><p name=\"5772\" id=\"5772\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">What happens if Alice and Erin never make another payment? Doris can request that Erin sign an update transaction eliminating the proportional hashlock.</p><p name=\"0ec4\" id=\"0ec4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What if Charlie wants to close the proportional hashlock? He can let Doris know that he wants to do this. At this point Doris can request that Erin sign an update transaction eliminating the proportional hashlock. If Doris does not do this, then Charlie can simply close the channel between him and Doris.</p><h3 name=\"d0de\" id=\"d0de\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Possible exploit? Alice sends the secrets to&#xA0;Charlie:</h3><p name=\"e7f3\" id=\"e7f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">What if Alice sends secrets to Charlie instead of Erin? Charlie will be able to redeem the proportion of the payment that Alice sent him the secrets for, and so will Bob. In effect, Alice is paying Charlie. Now, if Alice sends those same secrets to Erin, Erin can use them to get a payment from Doris. Doris can use them to get a payment from Charlie.</p><p name=\"1324\" id=\"1324\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So Charlie can&#x2019;t trust a payment from Alice, unless he can get Doris to agree to close their proportional hashlock immediately afterwards. But this doesn&#x2019;t matter, because Charlie is not supposed to be receiving the secrets from Alice anyway.</p><h3 name=\"dbac\" id=\"dbac\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">What is it good&#xA0;for?</h3><p name=\"9123\" id=\"9123\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing\">The actions taken in this scenario, and the incentives, are similar to a scenario where Alice sends Erin a series of separate normal multihop payments over the same set of intermediary nodes. The difference is that a payment of a certain size can be set up beforehand and then released slowly, with secrets flowing in one direction, without new payments needing to be set up. The secrets are also cache-able, and can be released in blocks. Also, the payment can be routed as one payment, which can reduce routing traffic. A lot of these goals could probably be accomplished in the routing protocol, but depending on how it was done, they could compromise the strong anonymity guarantees offered by routing protocols such as RPR.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"8018\" class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"6480\" id=\"6480\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Originally published at </em><a href=\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/proportional-hashlocks/\" data-href=\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/proportional-hashlocks/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">altheamesh.com</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p></div></div></section>\n","comment_id":null,"plaintext":"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2015-12-17 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2015-12-17 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2015-12-17 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nThis post assumes a pretty in-depth understanding of UPC and various cryptography concepts.

I suggested pong, as it is a very fast paced game that really emphasizes the scalability and speed of state channels. Playing pong on a state channel is somehow much more impressive than tic tac toe or chess. Thinking about state channels in terms of pong also loosened up my thinking around channels in general. We talked with Zaki for about an hour to find a good way to do it.</p><p name=\"fddd\" id=\"fddd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Alice and Bob send frames back and forth, both signing each valid frame. For example:</p><pre name=\"11c1\" id=\"11c1\" class=\"graf graf--pre graf-after--p\"><code class=\"markup--code markup--pre-code\">Alice -&gt; Bob<br>Frame:<br>    Sequence: 88<br>    Ball: 11,23<br>    Alice&apos;s paddle: 15<br>    Bob&apos;s paddle: 3<br><br>Bob -&gt; Alice<br>Frame:<br>    Sequence: 89 // Bump the sequence number<br>    Ball: 12,24 // The ball has moved according to pong &quot;physics&quot;<br>    Alice&apos;s paddle: 15<br>    Bob&apos;s paddle: 4 // Bob has moved his paddle</code></pre><p name=\"eed5\" id=\"eed5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pre\">Alice will sign the frame that Bob has given her if it is valid, i.e. if the sequence number is correctly incremented and if the ball has obeyed the laws of pong physics. The frame also contains an update of Bob&#x2019;s paddle position.</p><p name=\"f129\" id=\"f129\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They set up a contract on the blockchain that also understands the state transition from one frame to another. If given a frame signed by both Alice and Bob, the contract can of course establish that it is valid. The contract can also establish that a frame signed by only one of the participants is valid, given the frame before it signed by both. Also, as is the norm in state channels, frames with a higher sequence number override those with a lower sequence number. There is a challenge period of some length as well. After a frame is submitted, the contract waits for this amount of time before taking action on it (i.e. paying out some money to the winner).</p><p name=\"7b99\" id=\"7b99\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In addition to frames, the contract accepts a notice of forfeit, signed by only one of the participants. For instance, Alice can claim &#x201C;Bob forfeited&#x201D;. This can be overriden by a frame of any sequence number. If Bob does not post any valid frames during the challenge period, he forfeits the game.</p><p name=\"4e55\" id=\"4e55\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Let&#x2019;s say that Bob sees that Alice is about to win, and he would like to end the game without forfeiting the money that he has locked up in the contract as a bet or whatever. I will prove that it is not possible for Bob to do this.</p><p name=\"0c2c\" id=\"0c2c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If Bob simply disconnects and stops signing frames, Alice can send a notice of forfeiture to the contract. If Bob doesn&#x2019;t send a valid frame before the hold period is up, Alice gets the money.</p><p name=\"d409\" id=\"d409\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If Bob does send a valid frame, it&#x2019;s now up to Alice to send the next frame before the challenge period is over, otherwise she has forfeited. Alice and Bob could go back and forth like this until the end of the game, but this would be a very slow game, and very expensive because they would have to pay gas each time they submitted a frame.</p><p name=\"35ec\" id=\"35ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">It&#x2019;s in both of their interests to play honestly and keep all frames except for the last one off the chain, but the slow and inefficient frame-by-frame process is always there as a fallback to keep the players honest.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"847e\" class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"7f54\" id=\"7f54\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Originally published at </em><a href=\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/state-channel-pong/\" data-href=\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/state-channel-pong/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">altheamesh.com</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p></div></div></section>\n","comment_id":null,"plaintext":"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2016-07-27 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2016-07-27 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2016-07-27 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nThis is a quick writeup of some ideas that were discussed by myself, Ameen Soleimani, and Zaki Manian.\n","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5c3b7ce49d979809fa1c4c5f","uuid":"173a115e-bb37-4738-a869-171f831f939f","title":"Using C.O.R.E. to work on mesh network routing protocols","slug":"Using-C-O-R-E--to-work-on-mesh-network-routing-protocols-d1c77c118eb7","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Og9KuaHVbaDScTIe.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*09gOcWwwrZe82yRi.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*llqTnRgV8PDKA8z0.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*gwqkuAF_n1QjEdQ4.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sc0WC7ErHlTGTyMd.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"''' Babel service ''' import os from core.service import CoreService, addservice from core.misc.ipaddr import IPv4Prefix, IPv6Prefix class BabelMod(CoreService): ''' This is for babel ''' # a unique name is required, without spaces _name = \\\"BabelMod\\\" # you can create your own group here _group = \\\"Routing\\\" # this controls the starting order vs other enabled services _startindex = 50 # list of startup commands, also may be generated during startup _startup = ('sh /home/core/myservices/babel.sh',) # list of shutdown commands _shutdown = ('rm log') # this line is required to add the above class to the list of available services addservice(BabelMod)\"}],[\"code\",{\"code\":\"#!/bin/sh touch log /home/core/babeld/babeld eth0 -d 1 > log\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WxKfqwXXr7P43QYM.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*teG9COTZFfRWz_u5.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*peWJ2xXeuqmWdcL8.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*230RmKeQ_g50pclc.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"code\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/axn/mlc\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/emane\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/using-core-for-network-simulation/\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"C.O.R.E. may sound like the name of a 1980’s superhero team, but it is actually a tool that simulates wired and wifi networks, right down to the radio waves.

Clone the Babel repo, and make and install it etc. Now double click on one of the router nodes to bring up the terminal. You should be able to type something like <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">/home/core/babeld/babeld eth0 -d 1</code> to start babel.

Click on the &#x201C;Services&#x201D; button and make sure that only the &#x201C;IPForward&#x201D;, and the new &#x201C;BabelMod&#x201D; services are selected.</p><figure name=\"f505\" id=\"f505\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*teG9COTZFfRWz_u5.png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"600\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*teG9COTZFfRWz_u5.png\"></div></figure><p name=\"13d9\" id=\"13d9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Now you should be able to place nodes on the canvas, and have their babel instances start talking to each other.

Place 4 babel nodes on the canvas, 2 far apart from each other and 2 in the middle. Make one of the middle nodes a much better route than the other (closer to the 2 end nodes). Wait a few seconds, and you will see that the end nodes have routes to each other going through the better-placed middle node (you can check with Widgets-&gt;Observer Widgets-&gt;IPv4 Routes). You can also ping from one end node to the other to monitor packet loss.</p><figure name=\"a3f1\" id=\"a3f1\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 525px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*230RmKeQ_g50pclc.png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"600\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*230RmKeQ_g50pclc.png\"></div></figure><p name=\"0d96\" id=\"0d96\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing\">Now switch the positions of the middle nodes. You will see the packet loss jump, as the end nodes attempt to route packets through the middle node which is now in a bad position. After around 30 seconds, you will see throughput improve again as the new route is learned. If you check the routing tables of the end nodes, you will see that they contain the new and better route.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"8141\" class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"a531\" id=\"a531\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Originally published at </em><a href=\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/using-core-for-network-simulation/\" data-href=\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/using-core-for-network-simulation/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">altheamesh.com</em></a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">.</em></p></div></div></section>\n","comment_id":null,"plaintext":"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2016-08-01 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2016-08-01 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2016-08-01 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nC.O.R.E. may sound like the name of a 1980’s superhero team, but it is actually a tool that simulates wired and wifi networks, right down…\n","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5c3b7ce49d979809fa1c4c67","uuid":"b5c48384-cc97-44fa-abcd-624030d006df","title":"The free option problem","slug":"The-free-option-problem-f72f3ab40491","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/35828/is-it-possible-for-alice-and-bob-to-both-sign-a-message-simultaneously\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/state-channel-pong/\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://gnosis.pm/\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://altheamesh.com/blog/the-free-option-problem/\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The free option problem is an apparently inescapable problem in state channels.

Since Rust allows crates like Serde to provide syntactic sugar that gets turned into actual code the compiler structure has to accommodate code generation from a different source than itself.</p><p name=\"2636\" id=\"2636\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you go to compile a Rust program with #[derive(Serialize)] or some other property provided by a crate like Serde you&#x2019;re building a proc_macro crate, these special crates generate a compiler plugin that&#x2019;s used at compile time to build the code that #[derive(Serialize)] translates to.</p><p name=\"df3f\" id=\"df3f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So trying to crosscompile a proc_macro crate doesn&#x2019;t really make any sense. You only need the plugin to generate code and all of it&#x2019;s functionality is useless on the cross architecture you&#x2019;re building for. Therefore Cargo just tells you that this useless version of proc_macro doesn&#x2019;t exist.</p><p name=\"efad\" id=\"efad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is caused by having a specific type of useless dependency. If you&#x2019;ve tried to extend or define other proc macro traits you may have a <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">extern crate quote</code> and or <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">extern crate syn</code> somewhere that&#x2019;s no longer needed.</p><p name=\"8bd3\" id=\"8bd3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This can happen if you wrote some derivations that used proc-macro functionality and then re-factored them out without removing the dependency import. Since you aren&#x2019;t defining anything that actually needs a macro the compiler will let you leave off the required tag in the Cargo.toml.</p><p name=\"de86\" id=\"de86\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Inside of this edge case you will get the above error, it can be corrected by either removing the creates <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">quote</code> and <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">syn</code> if they are no longer needed or properly defining and using a macro in the crate that imports them.</p><p name=\"bf90\" id=\"bf90\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Big thanks to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@manishearth?source=post_header_lockup\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@manishearth?source=post_header_lockup\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">Manish Goregaokar</a> for helping improve this section of the article.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"723f\" class=\"section section--body\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><h3 name=\"494c\" id=\"494c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Linking</strong></h3><p name=\"d7a9\" id=\"d7a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">With the proc_macro issue gone we can try again.

There are some plans on the drawing board for turning a Raspberry PI into an automated flashing device. That just installs Althea into whatever you plug into it, no Linux know how required.</p><p name=\"8566\" id=\"8566\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We also need to secure a modern, cost-effective, and easy to flash supply of routers. N600&#x2019;s are great but hard to come by outside of occasional fire sales. Devices like the Turris Omnia are expensive overkill for anything but the most active of backbone nodes.</p><p name=\"78c4\" id=\"78c4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For those interested in playing around with the Althea Alpha drop by our <a href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#althea:matrix.org\" data-href=\"https://riot.im/app/#/room/#althea:matrix.org\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">chat</a> and ping me (@ttk2) if you&#x2019;re not afraid of the Linux terminal and have a couple of OpenWRT devices lying around we should be able to get things working.</p><p name=\"6c31\" id=\"6c31\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">If you want to help deploy Althea in your area shoot us an email at hello@altheamesh.com.

The answer is not well, it&#x2019;s being swapped with an Edgerouter.</p><p name=\"6567\" id=\"6567\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Sadly it doesn&#x2019;t look like the n600&#x2019;s are going to have a very long shelf life. After extensive debugging I have found their performance issues are due to slow context switching on their single core cpu&#x2019;s. They simply can&#x2019;t finish decrypting WireGuard packets fast enough.</p><p name=\"cdbc\" id=\"cdbc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We&#x2019;ve also found some really bizarre WireGuard issues with our Australia test deployment. The backhaul tunnel to the exit server goes on and off every couple of seconds. I think it&#x2019;s related to packet reordering on the backhaul network if I had to guess. More detailed investigation is in work.</p><p name=\"5754\" id=\"5754\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The Claskine deployment will be working on getting their <a href=\"https://www.natgeochasinggenius.com/video/3617\" data-href=\"https://www.natgeochasinggenius.com/video/3617\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">off grid tower</a> deployed and linked into the mesh on Wednesday, I hope to get some cool pictures from that to share with you.</p><figure name=\"251f\" id=\"251f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 625px; max-height: 349px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.800000000000004%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*9hHiWWQiiE4zferJHymTXA.png\" data-width=\"625\" data-height=\"349\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9hHiWWQiiE4zferJHymTXA.png\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The (in)famous Clatskanie gateway and some other equipment</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><section name=\"2f71\" class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"6025\" id=\"6025\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/althea-mesh/in-defense-of-the-slim-protocol-e2e481145108\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/althea-mesh/in-defense-of-the-slim-protocol-e2e481145108\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">Way back when</a> we talked about how promising on chain governance was.</p><p name=\"3b1b\" id=\"3b1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You may have seen the drafts floating around the Matrix channels, but it&#x2019;s essentially a pluggable governance architecture where people can create an administrative system for their local mesh group that raises a fund pool for common works and deals with administrating the local mesh. Exactly what the voting rules and such are is up to the users.</p><p name=\"716c\" id=\"716c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There&#x2019;s also a global level designed to maintain quality control and direct some funds to the company. Essentially a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">TCR</a> where you pay to register your deployment for use by our off the shelf devices. It&#x2019;s a good way to decentralize some of the more closed parts of having a real Althea product on shelves.</p><p name=\"9625\" id=\"9625\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#x2019;s a legitimately difficult task to both plan to generate revenue and ensure that the product is still fair and &#x2018;free&#x2019; as in freedom to user. It&#x2019;s a hard balance and I&#x2019;m sure some people will be upset no matter how we do it.

By decoupling compensation from centralized network control, Althea allows for networks that are more redundant, more efficient, and cheaper than traditional ISPs.</p><p name=\"784a\" id=\"784a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We&#x2019;ve been testing this model in our Clatskanie, OR test deployment, and it has attracted interest from a wide variety of people who want to start Althea networks around the world.</p><h3 name=\"5b27\" id=\"5b27\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Where is centralized still&#xA0;better?</h3><p name=\"4af6\" id=\"4af6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Centralized networks do still have advantages over the basic Althea model outlined above in a few key ways.</p><p name=\"95a7\" id=\"95a7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Network promotion: </strong>A centralized ISP can devote resources towards promoting their business and signing up customers. In an Althea network, payments go directly to the nodes carrying the traffic. One pattern that we have seen is where a property owner who has a good location for a node (a high rooftop usually) has little interest in going out and finding users to connect to their node.</p><p name=\"6cb7\" id=\"6cb7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Network quality control:</strong> A centralized ISP is a group of people who benefit from happy customers, since all the money flows through them. If the only payments are for bandwidth, then the only people in the system who will have incentive to hook customers up and keep them happy are people who can expect to sell them bandwidth. There could be a tragedy of the commons where nobody takes care of a network as a whole.</p><p name=\"2606\" id=\"2606\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Network security:</strong> If one entity controls every router on a network, as is the case with a conventional centralized ISP, then those routers can easily trust their neighbors, and other routers in the network. In the decentralized Althea model, the possibility exists that a router could lie about how good its connection to other routers or the internet is. If there is no factor limiting how many new routers are added to the network, an attacker could even cause routing to grind to a halt by advertising a million fake &#x201C;Sybil&#x201D; nodes.</p><h3 name=\"999a\" id=\"999a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Our solution: Althea&#xA0;subnets</strong></h3><p name=\"42fc\" id=\"42fc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Althea subnet organizations are groups of people empowered to play a role governing Althea subnets. First, let&#x2019;s review what a subnet is. A subnet is a group of routers who all operate in a common range of IP addresses, and can all route messages to each other. Basically a local Althea network.</p><p name=\"f315\" id=\"f315\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Some of the routers in the subnet may have a link to the broader internet. These are known as &#x201C;gateways&#x201D;. As long as there are a few good gateways in your subnet, you will have internet access. For this reason, subnets do not necessarily need to be very big. They need to be large enough to connect end users in an area to nearby gateways, but that&#x2019;s it.</p><p name=\"8036\" id=\"8036\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Also, a node can be part of more than one subnet. Most end users will not be part of more than one subnet, but larger nodes that serve end users in more than one subnet will obviously need to be.</p><h3 name=\"2beb\" id=\"2beb\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Subnet DAOs</h3><p name=\"fbb9\" id=\"fbb9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Subnet DAOs are decentralized organizations which are empowered to give out IP addresses in a given subnet, and have the option to collect a continous IP address renewal fee from the nodes using these IP addresses. By default, Althea subnet DAOs run on <a href=\"https://aragon.one\" data-href=\"https://aragon.one\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Aragon&#x2019;s DAO framework</a>, which provides interfaces and contract code for subnet organizers to vote on which nodes to give IP addresses, to appoint other subnet organizers, to manage cryptocurrency and cryptoassets held by the subnet DAO, and many other features.</p><p name=\"e90f\" id=\"e90f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This system has been designed drawing on our team&#x2019;s experiences helping run local meshnets. The intended use goes like this: a local group of volunteers, property owners, and entrepreneurs get together to start an Althea subnet in their area.</p><p name=\"44a8\" id=\"44a8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This group initializes a subnet DAO and adds the members of their group as organizers. Now they can give out IP addresses to people who want to get on the network. They can charge a small fee to each node as well. The fee is paid in the same cryptocurrency that is used bandwidth payments, probably Eth or DAI. This goes to the subnet DAO, and can be used to pay for promotion, meeting space, or other expenses, as well as rewarding the main organizers of the network in the area.</p><p name=\"7485\" id=\"7485\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is important, as it&#x2019;s common for property owners with good node locations not to be the type to go out and promote Althea, and for people who are good at community organizing and promotion to not own property with good node sites.</p><p name=\"2a0c\" id=\"2a0c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Subnet organizers are responsible making sure that users have a good experience on their subnet. This includes helping users get set up, connecting them to hardware installers, making sure they are in range of other nodes, making sure that nodes in the network are behaving reasonably, and stopping attacks on the network.</p><p name=\"2308\" id=\"2308\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If they do not do this well, users will complain, and word might get out that it would be easy, profitable, and good to vote them off the TCR.</p><h3 name=\"3580\" id=\"3580\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Decentralized quality assurance: The global&#xA0;TCR</h3><p name=\"62c1\" id=\"62c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">We expect that a lot of the early promotion of Althea will be done by subnet DAO organizers. However, Althea also has a large following of people who find out about it in the media or online, and will need to join a subnet to use the system. For this reason, we need a way to suggest high quality subnets in an area, and to weed out subnets that are providing a bad experience to users.</p><p name=\"d693\" id=\"d693\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The global TCR (or &#x201C;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@ilovebagels/token-curated-registries-1-0-61a232f8dac7\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">token curated registry</a>&#x201D;) lets a decentralized network govern a list of good subnets. The TCR model was pioneered by AdChain and has been adopted by many other projects, such as <a href=\"https://district0x.io/docs/district0x-whitepaper.pdf\" data-href=\"https://district0x.io/docs/district0x-whitepaper.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">district0x</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.foam.space/foam-token-curated-registries-for-geographic-points-of-interest-60d3c043f183\" data-href=\"https://blog.foam.space/foam-token-curated-registries-for-geographic-points-of-interest-60d3c043f183\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FOAM</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.joincivil.com/the-civil-registry-a-tcr-for-quality-journalism-a2452f363665\" data-href=\"https://blog.joincivil.com/the-civil-registry-a-tcr-for-quality-journalism-a2452f363665\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Civil</a>.</p><p name=\"5adf\" id=\"5adf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">From the <a href=\"https://altheamesh.com/governance-paper\" data-href=\"https://altheamesh.com/governance-paper\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Althea governance paper</a>:</p><blockquote name=\"1987\" id=\"1987\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Someone starting a subnet DAO can stake any amount of ALGT and be included on this list. Someone who feels that a subnet DAO should not be on the list can put down a matching deposit to initiate a vote to kick them off the list.</blockquote><blockquote name=\"6d3a\" id=\"6d3a\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">If the subnet DAO being challenged loses the vote (because it is known to be blatantly scammy or provide a very poor experience), then that registry is removed from the list, and its deposit is split between the challenger and the token holders who voted to take it off the list.</blockquote><blockquote name=\"039e\" id=\"039e\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">If the challenger loses the vote, then the reverse happens. The challenger&#x2019;s deposit is split between the token holders who voted to keep the subnet DAO on the list, and the subnet DAO itself.</blockquote><p name=\"928b\" id=\"928b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Several things can be done with this curated list of good subnets. First, we can use it to populate an online map, or other method for new users to find a subnet in their area to join. Subnets can claim an area of operation. They will then appear to new users entering an address within this area.</p><p name=\"37e1\" id=\"37e1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If there are multiple subnets active in an area, they will be ranked by amount staked on the TCR, weighted by the size of their claimed area. Subnets with a larger area will have to stake more to have a higher ranking. This is to prevent very large subnets from being able to easily appear at the top everywhere.</p><p name=\"5975\" id=\"5975\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Subnets with more staked have more to lose if they perform poorly. Subnets who claim to operate in an area outside the area that their intermediary nodes can realistically provide service will generate user complaints and may be kicked off of the list if they perform poorly enough.</p><p name=\"be97\" id=\"be97\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Nodes with standard Althea firmware will not be able to join subnets which are not on the global TCR. This is to stop a bad subnet which is making users unhappy from growing. The organizers could just start another subnet, but it would have to start from scratch and add new users.</p><h3 name=\"a254\" id=\"a254\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">What if I don&#x2019;t like the global&#xA0;TCR?</h3><p name=\"0030\" id=\"0030\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Althea&#x2019;s code is 100% open source, under the Apache 2.0 license. We make guides and documentation on how to work on the code and flash routers (aka install the Althea OS) a priority. If you don&#x2019;t like how the global TCR is being run, you can simply modify the software and flash it onto routers and give them out to people. You could make it so that these routers could join any subnet DAO, even if it&#x2019;s not on the TCR, or even fork the global TCR if you think it could be run better.</p><p name=\"78d3\" id=\"78d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">We expect that if the global TCR curation tokens are fairly and widely distributed among people who want to see Althea and incentivized mesh succeed, then the Althea global TCR will be the best way for new users who want cheap, fast broadband internet access to find a local subnet.</p></div></div></section>\n","comment_id":null,"plaintext":"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2018-06-01 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-06-01 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-06-01 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nAlthea is a system that lets routers pay each other directly for bandwidth, similar to how ISPs peer with one another on the internet…\n","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5c3b7ce49d979809fa1c4cdd","uuid":"52e2ff04-e398-4cc3-b892-5c04c7056e80","title":"Althea Development Update #50: Putting out fires in production","slug":"Althea-Development-Update--50--Putting-out-fires-in-production-a7546f7f5979","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*SVD3eLqq3BgEF39qPaYDYQ.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"TCP dump of dup acks trying to resolve out of order&nbsp;packets\"}],[\"hr\",{}],[\"hr\",{}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NN5lMLv35z7fnywWN70w7Q.jpeg\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://medium.com/althea-mesh/althea-development-update-49-alpha-3-and-starting-a-stable-release-schedule-7d77a67fcb29\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/althea-mesh/althea-firmware/releases/tag/v0.1.1\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://forum.altheamesh.com/t/althea-performance/44\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Last \"],[0,[0],1,\"update\"],[0,[],0,\" we created a ‘stable’ release channel and rolled out our latest and greatest to the 7 devices we had in production.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"By production I mean on real radios and in other people’s homes as a source of internet access.

For those of you not familiar this graph represents a call stack, going up the deeper &#x2018;down&#x2019; the callstack you go. Length is a relative measure of how much cpu time was spent in a given function.</p><p name=\"a368\" id=\"a368\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The below graphs where captured over 100 second intervals during an iperf UDP test from kworker threads using a kernel compiled with as identical as possible flags.</p><p name=\"93ef\" id=\"93ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The n600 is a pretty old device, it runs a 560mhz AR9344 MIPS core right out of 2011. Variants of this core are popular into even modern routers. Tested speed with Althea is ~25mbps.</p><p name=\"27ff\" id=\"27ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The GL-B1300 is a brand new quad core 717mhz ARM chip Atheros IPQ4028. Tested speed with Althea is ~100mbps.</p><p name=\"16a1\" id=\"16a1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Considering the process and architecture improvements between these two processors we should be seeing a lot more than a 4x improvement. The latter processor is easily a dozen times more powerful.</p><p name=\"5e5b\" id=\"5e5b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The reason we&#x2019;re focusing on processing power is that in our design with Althea we actually nest two WireGuard tunnels. One to provide security for your traffic as it traverses out to the internet, the other exists between every hop. A very important part of being able to bill for traffic is being able to identify who is responsible for paying for that traffic.</p><p name=\"0c2c\" id=\"0c2c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since each hop pays the hop adjacent to it in our system WireGuard is actually the most expedient way to authenticate traffic is actually from the peer who will be billed. In theory we could improve efficiency by removing the chacha20 encryption and only using the poly1305 authentication.</p><p name=\"419f\" id=\"419f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is even something we seriously discussed as it became clear even modern devices where not performing to expectations. But I decided to do some more investigating before going down that route.</p><p name=\"2608\" id=\"2608\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the graph for the n600 CPU time dominated by WireGuard tasks. So much so that the iptables and routing rules remain thin little licks of &#x2018;flame&#x2019;.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure name=\"4913\" id=\"4913\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 1000px; max-height: 405px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 40.5%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*A02uY8VORZ_yVodWuwBpIQ.png\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"486\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*A02uY8VORZ_yVodWuwBpIQ.png\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Kernel worker thread sample for the&#xA0;n600</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"36bf\" id=\"36bf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">But the picture painted by the B1300 is very different.

It&#x2019;s not so much that iptables tasks are larger on the B1300 as WireGuard tasks are massively smaller.</p><p name=\"e39f\" id=\"e39f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The similarly optimized MIPS implementation does impressive work for such an old processor. But exactly as expected the newer device blows it out of the water.</p><p name=\"3cdb\" id=\"3cdb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So then why is it only 4x faster?</p><p name=\"1732\" id=\"1732\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The answer is packet forwarding hardware acceleration. While the n600 achieves it&#x2019;s sticker 100mbps running stock OpenWRT most modern routers need special drivers to reach their sticker performance.</p><p name=\"e75b\" id=\"e75b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Testing the B1300 with stock OpenWRT reveals it gets&#x2026;. about 100mbps throughput without WireGuard. The CPU is easily powerful enough to perform the WireGuard operations, exactly as I estimated.</p><p name=\"1d4c\" id=\"1d4c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">To be honest I also suspected packet acceleration issues before I began, but it&#x2019;s good to have rock solid confirmation.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"b265\" class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"1850\" id=\"1850\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">The conclusions we can draw here are that on modern devices Althea&#x2019;s encryption/authentication stack is efficient enough to not be a problem.

As we walk to a cleaner place to eat, a hat vendor keeps pace with us, in case we may change our mind about a hat purchase today, and there in a courtyard, I see a man in full armor, waiting, I surmise, for someone to take a picture and give him a tip.

The transformation of Comuna 13 is something Medellin is proud of, and there are even tourist “graffiti tours” in another part of the neighborhood, where the government has installed escalators.

(the LiteBeam is a smaller cpe radio, or customer premises equipment, for use in this case at intermediary nodes to connect them with the main sector antennas at the school.) We first hook up the sector antennas temporarily at Son Bata so we can bridge them and show the home owners how they can aim the LiteBeams.

It’s perfect for this location because we have a bit more room and we can use the extra performance a desktop can provide. Unfortunately, Claro did not keep their appointment time, or call us to let us know they would not be coming. We did, however, have a great conversation with some local young people, one of whom was holding an injured bird in his hand.

As I walked back that night, I heard the band playing&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Bon Jovi&#x2019;s &#x201C;It&#x2019;s My Life&#x201D;, sung in heavily accented English, from a Hard Rock Caf&#xE9;.</p><p name=\"f24a\" id=\"f24a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Day 2: Shopping</strong></p><p name=\"6c8d\" id=\"6c8d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The red_medellin team has chosen <a href=\"https://morada.co/\" data-href=\"https://morada.co/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Casa Morad</a>a, a location nearby the Comuna, to beam the wireless backhaul to a school at the top where the sector antennas will broadcast internet throughout the community. We will need a roof mount for the RocketDish antennas chosen for Casa Morada. Jehan, who&#x2019;s also working on Althea, has arrived this morning and shown some skepticism that the rocket&#x2019;s antenna, a 31dbi dish which looks quite large in its cardboard packaging, is perhaps overkill for this less that 5km shot to the school. He communicates this observation through subtle chuckles and ponders whether the smaller NanoBeam antenna may have been adequate.</p><p name=\"bb41\" id=\"bb41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Andrew, Kelsey and I go to take a look at the roof at Casa Morada, and it&#x2019;s determined that a non-penetrating roof mount, will do the trick. Where do you buy a non-penetrating roof mount in Medellin, though? The typical way of buying things online doesn&#x2019;t work here, and even in the United States it is a specialty item not available at hardware stores.</p><p name=\"b256\" id=\"b256\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We decide to head to the market areas of town, a place with streets of many small vendors. The vendors here typically have a small area to display their merchandise and hand you the items from behind counters. And the carts! Many sturdy, well-made carts are loaded down with fruit, vegetables or other wares and parked or rolled up and down the street. Some vendors, weary of calling out the name of their goods, have pre-recorded advertisements played on antiquated loud speakers. I&#x2019;m reminded of the cart in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXkxaNL7OHs\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXkxaNL7OHs\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">popular Colombian music video</a>, one laden down with a 70s era speaker system and rolled down the hill behind dancing people.</p><figure name=\"3109\" id=\"3109\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 394px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*voiL_-mdqh2iOLV4xPrzmQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"5344\" data-height=\"3006\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*voiL_-mdqh2iOLV4xPrzmQ.jpeg\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Shopping for a roof&#xA0;mount.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"9f25\" id=\"9f25\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We stop at the hardware vendor, who points us three blocks down to a sort of industrial section of town. We pass restaurant equipment, motorcycle repair shops, and finally see the welding sparks we were looking for. We show the welder a picture and Andrew, who speaks fluent Spanish, helps negotiate price and delivery. He can manufacture and deliver the stand tomorrow, so our work here is done. As we walk to a cleaner place to eat, a hat vendor keeps pace with us, in case we may change our mind about a hat purchase today, and there in a courtyard, I see a man in full armor, waiting, I surmise, for someone to take a picture and give him a tip. But, why, I wonder? Does full medieval armor have any cultural significance? He seems very out of place as he stands alone in the heat. What led him down this occupational path? I wish I spoke Spanish&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;I would have asked.</p><figure name=\"90ad\" id=\"90ad\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 476px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 68%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*WZ2rCGe65EQlvheih3Bthw.jpeg\" data-width=\"2965\" data-height=\"2017\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WZ2rCGe65EQlvheih3Bthw.jpeg\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The man in&#xA0;armor.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"7142\" id=\"7142\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In the afternoon, we make our first trip to Comuna 13. Comuna 13 used to be a very violent place; a place controlled by Parmilitares, FARC, and ELN because of its strategic location suited to the transport of cocaine and weaponry. Recently, the government has made many strides to improve infrastructure and transform Medellin into a what is now a popular tourist destination. The transformation of Comuna 13 is something Medellin is proud of, and there are even tourist &#x201C;graffiti tours&#x201D; in another part of the neighborhood, where the government has installed escalators. Something about a bunch of rich tourists on some glitzy tour of how poor people live doesn&#x2019;t quite sit right with me though.</p><figure name=\"a436\" id=\"a436\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 525px; max-height: 679px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 129.29999999999998%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*a1fPMbfM54yEVf3z1aTA5w.jpeg\" data-width=\"2989\" data-height=\"3865\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*a1fPMbfM54yEVf3z1aTA5w.jpeg\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The inclined road that leads to Son Bata and the&#xA0;school.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"60e6\" id=\"60e6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The taxi cabs stops at the bottom of the hill at an intersection and a place with a few small grocery shops and restaurants.

And then we hike, up the steep incline of the main street and up multiple staircases and inclines. Most of the people here are under the age of sixty, and we see signs of daily life as we walk&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;a hair dresser is braiding hair, children are playing, and music comes from one of the many houses piled on top of each other.</p><p name=\"dfab\" id=\"dfab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We hike to the top of the Comuna where the small school is located&#x200A;&#x2014;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">&#x200A;escuelita</em>, I hear one of the children call it.

They head back to the Comuna and hold a community meeting. There are about fifteen attendees at the meeting. Many here are people wishing to be an intermediary node, which is a house that connects to other houses nearby and earns some money from forwarding bandwidth along. Here in the dense housing environment, these homes will be connected with an outdoor rated ethernet cable. The team also installs the first client node at Tomario&#x2019;s house. Tomario quickly takes to learning how to crimp networking cables and installing the LiteBeam antennas. It&#x2019;s interesting to envision how this group of local people building and supporting the network, a <a href=\"https://altheamesh.com/governance-paper\" data-href=\"https://altheamesh.com/governance-paper\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subnet DAO</a>, might coalesce here.</p><figure name=\"3c6a\" id=\"3c6a\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 526px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75.1%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*4jkIDUivQMi-0FeXgx_2Fg.jpeg\" data-width=\"2296\" data-height=\"1724\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4jkIDUivQMi-0FeXgx_2Fg.jpeg\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">The RocketDish antenna at Casa&#xA0;Morada.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"3513\" id=\"3513\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Day 4: A late start</strong></p><p name=\"5b95\" id=\"5b95\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Forrest and I got a late start but did manage to do some shopping for supplies, flash the EdgeRouter x for use at the school, and set up the the PrismStations (the sector antennas).</p><p name=\"d90e\" id=\"d90e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Day 5: The school</strong></p><p name=\"76ae\" id=\"76ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We went back to Comuna 13 again. We were hoping this time to get a definitive answer from school staff that we could locate the receiving end of the wireless backhaul and the sector antennas here. Up to this point, many phone calls and conversations have gone back and forth, attempting to determine just who had the final say in the matter. Many of the critical elements of this project come down to getting the &#x201C;yes&#x201D; from the appropriate person.

Many small school children flock around us, asking questions and practicing their best &#x201C;hellos&#x201D; in English. While the school administrator likes the project, she needs to see more diagrams and a written description of the mounting plans. There is still time in the day to do more of the LiteBeam installs. (the LiteBeam is a smaller cpe radio, or customer premises equipment, for use in this case at intermediary nodes to connect them with the main sector antennas at the school.) We first hook up the sector antennas temporarily at Son Bata so we can bridge them and show the home owners how they can aim the LiteBeams. Most of the people living in Comuna 13 own their homes, and I&#x2019;m told a home here sells for around $5000.</p><figure name=\"ac88\" id=\"ac88\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 394px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*Q-09LSWq8qihKSop1lpraA.jpeg\" data-width=\"5344\" data-height=\"3006\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Q-09LSWq8qihKSop1lpraA.jpeg\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Jehan installs ethernet cable at an intermediary node.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"64b1\" id=\"64b1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We do a quick setup at one of the more colorful homes, set up high on the hillside where we find the antenna almost impossible to not aim correctly with such perfect line of sight. Jehan and I have to leave earlier than the rest of the group for an interview at Espacio, a local media incubator, which means we have to attempt to catch a taxi. This proves to be a rather difficult and we walk for some distance before finding success. This gives me the opportunity to spot some horses tied up at a nearby school and a poster which lists the prices for internet. red_medellin plans to provide Althea internet to the Comuna for 600 COP a GB, far lower than the current ISP&#x2019;s 27,000 COP for 1.3GB. The day ends with a trip to the Blockchain Center and Andrew gives a presentation in Spanish about Althea to local Ethereum enthusiasts. There is free pizza offered here, just like Ethereum meetups in the United States.</p><figure name=\"e706\" id=\"e706\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*G2UK5Qh3tfQFqXeH9knNgA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1079\" data-height=\"720\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*G2UK5Qh3tfQFqXeH9knNgA.jpeg\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Kelsey, Forrest, and Andrew present Althea at the Blockchain Center.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"0631\" id=\"0631\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Day 6: The Last Day</strong></p><p name=\"fce7\" id=\"fce7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#x2019;s my last full day in Medellin and we have heard that Claro might be installing the backhaul internet at Casa Morada today. We head there, hoping that is the case and that we can finish installing the Althea router. The router chosen as the Althea gateway is, in fact, just an older Dell Optiplex that has been flashed with the Althea firmware. It&#x2019;s perfect for this location because we have a bit more room and we can use the extra performance a desktop can provide. Unfortunately, Claro did not keep their appointment time, or call us to let us know they would not be coming. We did, however, have a great conversation with some local young people, one of whom was holding an injured bird in his hand. Andrew and Kelsey also took the opportunity to share with me the amazing public transit system and we took a tram ride over another part of Comuna 13. Medellin&#x2019;s public transport system is a source of pride, as indeed it should be&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;it&#x2019;s kept clean and orderly and dozens of people direct traffic and keep things moving forward.</p><figure name=\"c200\" id=\"c200\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 394px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.3%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*vWY-4AfWYOfoXRveoI9pqg.jpeg\" data-width=\"5344\" data-height=\"3006\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vWY-4AfWYOfoXRveoI9pqg.jpeg\"></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Better than two in a bush supposedly.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"c0bb\" id=\"c0bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing\">I am excited to see the progress as red_medellin continues to move things forward with their Althea deployment.

This doesn&#x2019;t actually involve any changes to the software at all. <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/f1db9bdd6792\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/u/f1db9bdd6792\" data-anchor-type=\"2\" data-user-id=\"f1db9bdd6792\" data-action-value=\"f1db9bdd6792\" data-action=\"show-user-card\" data-action-type=\"hover\" class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Kilpatrick</a> and the rest of our dev team have done a really great job writing software that helps people easily set up networks without many of the configuration and equipment selection headaches that usually come along with a new network. Althea networks configure themselves autonomously (barring a few stubborn bugs!). Network architecture is not something that the person setting up the network needs to think about with Althea.</p><p name=\"7ca6\" id=\"7ca6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">As Althea networks mature, and people using the network understand that they can earn money reselling, strengthening, and expanding the network, bandwidth payments will become a bigger part of the picture.</p></div></div></section>\n","comment_id":null,"plaintext":"","feature_image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Xy2wm2DYNkSq_nPi_rxBZQ.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"created_at":"2018-10-21 00:00:00","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-10-21 00:00:00","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-10-21 00:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"\nMe and Deborah Simpier were just talking about the role of decentralized node-to-node payments vs “federated” subnet DAO payments in…\n","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5c3b7ce49d979809fa1c4d32","uuid":"059db00d-2699-421b-ac79-f69e7ec9a714","title":"Althea Development Update #59: Experiments in real world payments","slug":"Althea-Development-Update--59--Experiments-in-real-world-payments-dd9cd7e58dce","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}],[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://althea.org/\",\"rel\",\"noopener\"]],[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Check out our new website \"],[0,[0],1,\"Althea.org\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"We’re approaching testnet readiness with bandwidth payments and we’ve started working on how to present the concept of device to device payments to people in the real world.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This is an exciting milestone that brings up some very important questions.\"]]],[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[],0,\"What kinds of incentives are really best at motivating people to sell bandwidth?\"]],[[0,[],0,\"What kind of investment are people willing to make to do so?\"]],[[0,[],0,\"What pain-points can we address in the design?\"]]]],[10,0],[1,\"h4\",[[0,[],0,\"Designing an experiment in payments\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Testnet bandwidth payments are on schedule to start next week, but I won’t be surprised if it’s the end of November before they are stable enough for real world testing to begin.

For example a 20Mbps DSL connection will easily be maxed out by that same family of four we were talking about earlier.</p><p name=\"585f\" id=\"585f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The statistics collected by the FCC in 2016 bear this out.</p><figure name=\"ffaf\" id=\"ffaf\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 447px;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.9%;\"></div><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*rUZtuxxW4DH9elSf\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"511\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rUZtuxxW4DH9elSf\"></div></figure><p name=\"f086\" id=\"f086\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Chart 15.3 from the <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/measuring-broadband-america/measuring-fixed-broadband-report-2016\" data-href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/measuring-broadband-america/measuring-fixed-broadband-report-2016\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FCC 2016 broadband report</a></p><p name=\"ff8c\" id=\"ff8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">American cable and fiber internet users get somewhere between ~80% of their advertised download speeds during peak hours. The number for DSL is much lower, with a mere 50% of the users getting the advertised speed during peak hours (Weekdays 6:30pm&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;11pm).</p><p name=\"0543\" id=\"0543\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Oversubscription isn&#x2019;t inherently evil. But it decouples what ISPs sell from what people use and even what the ISP is actually capable of delivering.</p><p name=\"3ec6\" id=\"3ec6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This sort of intentional obfuscation of what you are buying and what is being sold is typical of monopolies. The more clearly defined the price and service, the more easily customers can replace one provider with another.</p><h4 name=\"50d7\" id=\"50d7\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Althea&#x2019;s billing&#xA0;model</h4><p name=\"9376\" id=\"9376\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Althea works like your electricity or water bills, you pay for what you actually use.</p><p name=\"84d8\" id=\"84d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With Althea your home WiFi router acts as a personal shopper to buy internet bandwidth over the cheapest and best path every second, seamlessly. Even if you have only one connection yourself, the router will still get faster service and cheaper prices as the network reorganizes further upstream.</p><p name=\"bba1\" id=\"bba1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you participate in passing traffic for other people you&#x2019;ll find some of the money they paid as extra money added to your account.</p><p name=\"6b2c\" id=\"6b2c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It&#x2019;s important to focus on the &#x2018;personal shopper&#x2019; concept. You put money into your account to be spent over the course of the month.</p><p name=\"9a80\" id=\"9a80\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Like a prepaid phone plan, it&#x2019;s impossible to end up paying more than you have deposited into the account. Unlike a prepaid phone plan the money doesn&#x2019;t leave your home until it&#x2019;s used, it lives in your Althea router.</p><p name=\"b6f3\" id=\"b6f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">With a traditional ISP you must trust the privacy of your web browsing to the provider of the connection to your home. In most countries major ISPs sell your browsing data to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/att-buying-company-that-delivers-targeted-ads-based-on-your-web-browsing/\" data-href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/att-buying-company-that-delivers-targeted-ads-based-on-your-web-browsing/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">advertisers</a>.</p><p name=\"e50e\" id=\"e50e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Althea uses an integrated VPN to easily and automatically protect your privacy from whomever may be carrying your traffic.
